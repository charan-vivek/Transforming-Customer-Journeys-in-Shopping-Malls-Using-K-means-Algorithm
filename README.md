## Transforming-Customer-Journeys-in-Shopping-Malls-Using-K-means-Algorithm
Small description about the project like one below
Segmenting the customer needs by providing the require products and also to increase the sales of the shopping malls.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Management and maintain of customer relationship have always played a vital role to provide business intelligence to organizations to build, manage and develop valuable long term customer relationships. The importance of treating customers as an organizations main asset is increasing in value in  present day and era.  Organizations have  an interest to  invest in  the development of customer acquisition, maintenance and development strategies. The business intelligence has a vital  role  to  play  in  allowing  companies  to  use  technical  expertise  to  gain  better  customer knowledge and Programs for outreach. By using clustering techniques like k-means, customers with similar means are clustered together.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The significance of customer segmentation in attracting the customers towards the products which in turn aids the increase in the business scale in the market. By segmenting the customer group into the different groups according to the similarities they possess, on one hand, helps the marketers to provide customized ads, products, and offers. where on other hand it supports the customers by avoiding them from the confusion of the products to buy. Comparing the clusters obtained by deploying the three different clustering algorithms on the customers’ data using the metrics that measure the distinctness and uniqueness of the clusters.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
